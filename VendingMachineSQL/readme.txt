Vending Machine V.2

Created the backend for a web application. Requirement was no JavaScript/jQuery so as to see how the apps would work without them. Overall, pretty straightforward, but the lack of dynamically updating data really gives the site a dated feel (reloads for every button click). 

At this point, we've moved on from in memory / file storage and are using MySQL. Created the (fairly simple) table and connected it through SpringMVC and JDBC.

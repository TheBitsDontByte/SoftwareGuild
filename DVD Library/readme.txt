DVD Library (no persistence)

Backed was provided by The Software Guild, frontend build using HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript and jQuery.

First experince with jQuery, ajax call were interesting, especially the dynamic refreshing of data on pages. Error handling
was also new, I felt that by implementing that I went from being able to throw something together to being able to design
something that could be considered presentable.
